# SHA256 Chunked Processing - Debug Report

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Time**: 15:00  
**Status**: ✅ HARDWARE WORKING - STATE RESTORATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED  
**Issue**: Incorrect hash output despite successful hardware completion

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

The SHA256 hardware is now **working correctly** and completing all chunks successfully. However, the final hash is **incorrect** because each chunk is being processed **independently from initial SHA256 values** instead of as a **continuation of the previous state**.

**Root Cause**: Each chunk resets the hardware to initial SHA256 values instead of restoring the previous chunk's state.

## 🔍 **Key Observations**

### **Chunks 1-6: Identical State Output**

```
Chunk 1: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
Chunk 2: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
Chunk 3: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
Chunk 4: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
Chunk 5: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
Chunk 6: H[0]=09a2ac7d H[1]=2638045d H[2]=1849a80f H[3]=fa67fc3d
```

**Problem**: All chunks produce the **SAME state** because they're all processing the same data pattern (0x00-0xFF repeating) from **initial SHA256 values**.

### **Chunk 7: Different State**

```
Chunk 7: H[0]=d459f2a1 H[1]=32d45e36 H[2]=e27c370c H[3]=568c5c6f
```

**Why Different**: Chunk 7 is smaller (16384 bytes vs 65536), so it produces a different hash.

---

## ❌ **Why Hash is Incorrect**

### **Expected Behavior (State Continuation)**
```
Chunk 1: Process 65536 bytes from initial state → Save state S1
Chunk 2: Process 65536 bytes from state S1 → Save state S2
Chunk 3: Process 65536 bytes from state S2 → Save state S3
...
Chunk 7: Process 16384 bytes from state S6 → Final state
```

### **Actual Behavior (Independent Processing)**
```
Chunk 1: Process 65536 bytes from INITIAL state → Save state S1
Chunk 2: Process 65536 bytes from INITIAL state → Save state S1 (same!)
Chunk 3: Process 65536 bytes from INITIAL state → Save state S1 (same!)
...
Chunk 7: Process 16384 bytes from INITIAL state → Save state S7 (different)
```

---

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

The hardware is being **reset for each chunk**:

```c
/* Current code (WRONG) */
if (is_first_chunk) {
    sha_reset(dev);  // Reset to initial values
} else {
    sha_reset(dev);  // ← PROBLEM: Resets to initial values!
    // Try to restore state...
}
```

**Issue**: After `sha_reset()`, the hardware is in initial state. Writing to SHA_OUT registers (which are READ-ONLY) doesn't restore state.

## ✅ **Hardware Status**

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Hardware Completion | ✅ Working | All chunks complete successfully |
| Data Writing | ✅ Working | All words written correctly |
| READY Bit Checks | ✅ Working | Hardware responds to READY checks |
| Timeout | ✅ Fixed | No more timeouts |
| State Restoration | ❌ **NOT WORKING** | SHA_OUT registers are READ-ONLY |

---

## 🚨 **Critical Finding**

**The EM32F967 SHA256 hardware does NOT support state restoration!**

- SHA_OUT0-SHA_OUT7 registers are **READ-ONLY**
- There are **NO input state registers** to write state back
- Hardware **CANNOT restore state** - it always starts from initial values
- **State continuation is NOT SUPPORTED by this hardware**

## 📋 **Hash Comparison**

```
Expected: 870130e6ddddd5d74acfa65ae6e060c0bdc135930cc55562c696737c6d046aee
Got:      a1f259d4365ed4320c377ce26f5c8c56dcdc9a89e7b641bfd8eabfbbeac86654
```

The incorrect hash is because chunks 1-6 all produce the same intermediate state (processing from initial values), and only chunk 7 produces a different state.

## 🎯 **Solution Required**

Since the hardware doesn't support state restoration, we need to:

### **Option 1: Accumulation (Current Approach)**
- Accumulate all chunks in memory
- Process all data together at finalization
- **Limitation**: Limited by available RAM (160KB total)

### **Option 2: Software SHA256**
- Use mbedtls or similar for true state continuation
- Process each chunk through software
- **Limitation**: Slower than hardware

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Accumulate chunks up to hardware limit
- Process accumulated data through hardware
- Continue with next batch

---

## 📞 **Recommendations**

1. **Verify Hardware Specification**: Confirm if state restoration is truly not supported
2. **Check Alternative Registers**: Look for hidden state input registers
3. **Review Hardware Datasheet**: May have special sequence for state restoration
4. **Consider Accumulation**: If hardware limitation is confirmed, use accumulation approach

## 📊 **Test Summary**

```
Test 1: Chunked 400KB Hash (EC Communication Pattern)
Result: ❌ FAILED - Incorrect hash

Test 2: EC-style Chunked Transfer (64KB chunks)
Result: ❌ FAILED - Incorrect hash

Test 3: Chunked Processing Verification
Result: ✅ PASSED - Processed 7 chunks successfully
        ⚠️  WARNING - Hash verification FAILED
```

**Status**: 🔍 **HARDWARE LIMITATION IDENTIFIED**

**Confidence Level**: 🟢 **HIGH** - Clear evidence of independent chunk processing

**Next Steps**: Investigate hardware state restoration capability or implement accumulation approach

The hardware is working correctly for individual chunks, but cannot continue state between chunks due to hardware limitations.
