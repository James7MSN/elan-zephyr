  Elan EM32 Battery-Backed RAM (BBRAM) driver

  The EM32 family provides 64 bytes (16 Ã— 32-bit registers) of backup registers
  that retain data when powered by backup battery (VBAT).
  
  Note: This driver uses hardware-specific clock gating (BKP clock bit 24)
  rather than the generic clock control framework.

  Example:
    bbram0: bbram@40033000 {
        compatible = "elan,em32-bbram";
        reg = <0x40033000 0x40>;
        backup-regs-count = <16>;
        status = "okay";
    };

compatible: "elan,em32-bbram"
